				No different is nothing more than an outlook, a perspective. It’s the perspective that every person we meet, white, black, Hispanic, gay, trans, Asian, Muslim, or Jewish is fundamentally no different than us.
				<br> <br>
				Yes their skin color, belief system, or religion maybe be different than ours, but ultimately they are human. Human like us. 
				<br> <br>					
				We're driven by the same biological needs. Needs of appreciation, community, and belonging. We often forget we belong to the same species. We all share feelings of fear, anxiety, joy, and pain.
				<br> <br>
				No different pushes for non-judgement and acceptance. It's a call to action to think twice about how our life's conditioning may influence our perception of others.  
				<br> <br>
				Consider two adorable toddlers, one hispanic and one native American crafting beautiful water color paintings with each other. When the toddlers look at each other they don't see color, race, or religion. They don't know about this yet. All they see is another human being who may need a little more water in their paint. They see a friend, a companion. They play, accept, and share with one another as if they were family members. It's similar to Zen Buddhist's "beginner's mind." Beginner's mind or Shoshin refers to an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject. In this case, the subject is other people. 
				<br> <br>
				Adopting the perspective of no different challenges us to be aware of our prejudices or preconceptions. Ones which don't serve us and may eliminate the opportunity to meet someone.
				<br> <br>
				At the end of the day we don't know each others stories or self narratives. We're unaware of everyone elses upbringing - we don’t know about their traumatic experiences. Often times, we're completely oblivious to the experiences which have molded their personality and guide their reasoning. So, why judge? 
				<br> <br>
				No different is a perspective I've slowly grown to adopt in my life. This perspective has opened the door for numerous opportunities and learning experiences. It's given me tremendous insight into the human experience. In the process of adopting this, I've become more empathetic and compassionate. 
				<br> <br>
				The more we can perceive objectively and listen with no intent to judge, the more we can learn about others and their experiences. The perspective of no different should facilitate a new type of understanding. A profound understanding of our human relatives.
